# Nigeria-X
2D Game engine programmed in and for Visual Basic
Coded by me

Nigeria is just a folder structure and accompanying code designed for extrapolation into dynamic 2D games.
I want to say anything is really possible depending on how one expands on what's already there. I'm in the
process of building some kind of RPG for it as a project; certainly things like platformers would also be
viable given time and effort.

Eventually I'd like to mess around with either OpenGL or XNA and get 3D support for this thing, but that comes
much later I suppose. As it stands this is very much a work-in-progress; still laboring away at making it more
polished and clean, but above all else, functional.
